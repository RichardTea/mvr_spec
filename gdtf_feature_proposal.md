### GDTF Monthly Interfacing Meeting Participant 

GDTF Monthly Interfacing Meeting Participants are people who attend the open Monthly Interfacing Meeting hosted by the GDTF Group. In there they can propose features, discuss and comment on proposals presented by the GDTF Content Group. We suggest and ask that people who are interested in reporting issues and asking for features do join the Monthly Interfacing Meeting.
Has read access to the GitHub Spec repository and can create issues and comment on them.

## Stages

1. Feature Request
    - Feature Request can be made by GDTF Monthly Interfacing Meeting Participant by creating an issue in GitHub
    - Feature Request can be made GDTF Content Group Member by creating an issue in GitHub

    The submitter might be asked to provide some suggestions/proposal for how to implement this feature request into the GDTF Spec.

2. Feature Request Scheduling

    GDTF Content Group discusses new Issues and schedules them. The following criteria will be used for this:

    | Target Version   |  Criteria | 
    |------------------|-----------|
    | v1.2 (+1)        | Direct impact on the current products  |   
    | v1.3 (+2)        | Used for planned feature in the products  |   
    | v99  (+X)        | Nice to have, but not directly impacting the products  |   

3. Working Phase
    
    GDTF Content Group will work on a proposal on how to implement a feature request into the GDTF Spec.

4. Presenting Proposal

    GDTF Content Group will present the proposal to the Monthly Interfacing Meeting. The proposal will be discussed. The proposal will be handed out as draft to the members of the meeting so they can review it.

5. Consideration Phase

    We will wait for 4 weeks to get feedback from the Monthly Interfacing Meeting. If there are not comments, we will make the proposal part of the Spec. Otherwise we will step back to the Working Phase.

6. Adding proposal to the GDTF Spec

    After passing the above stages, we will make the proposal part of the GDTF Spec.
